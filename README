*** Public Domain Functional Programming in C *** 

This small project is aimed at creating some public-domain C code (using a functional-programming approach) 
for manipulating data structures - mostly lists.  

Acknowledgement - I have included the file "stb.h" in this project.  That is a very good public-domain C utility 
library. It was done by Sean Barrett, and is from here - http://nothings.org/stb/stb_h.html .  
Many thanks to Sean for doing that! 
*********************************************************************************************************************************

The aim is for pdfpc to eventually cover all of the following areas -  

*  Filter 
*  Map  
*  Sort  
*  Any 
*  All 
*  Elem ( Array membership  (the "in" operator)  ) 
*  NotElem ( Array non-membership  (the "not in" operator)   )  
*  Init 
*  Last 
*  Lookup 
*  Pred 
*  Succ 
*  Replicate 
*  SplitAt 
*  Concat (join) 
*  Slice - Done 
*  Head - Done 
*  Tail - Done 
*  Length - Done 
*  Take  
*  Drop  
*  Foldl  
*  Foldr  
*  Zip 

This code is released to the public domain.
