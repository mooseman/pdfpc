*** Public Domain Functional Programming in C *** 

This small project is aimed at creating some public-domain 
C code (using a functional-programming approach) for 
manipulating data structures - mostly lists.  

Acknowledgement - I have included the file "stb.h" in this project.  
That is a very good public-domain C utility library. It was done by 
Sean Barrett, and is from here - 
http://nothings.org/stb/stb_h.html .  
Many thanks to Sean for doing that! 
*****************************************************

The aim is for pdfpc to eventually cover all of the following 
areas. Note that Lpred and Lsucc are different to Haskell's 
"pred" and "succ" functions.  
Those functions work on enums - these ones work on arrays.  

*  All 
*  Any 
*  Append (++)  
*  Concat (join) 
*  Cons (:)  
*  Drop  
*  Elem ( Array membership  (the "in" operator)  ) 
*  ElemIndex 
*  Filter 
*  Find 
*  FindIndex 
*  FindIndices 
*  Fold - Done  
*  Fst 
*  Group 
*  GroupBy
*  Head - Done 
*  Init 
*  Insert 
*  InsertBy
*  Intersect 
*  IntersectBy 
*  Intersperse - Done 
*  IsPrefixOf 
*  IsSuffixOf 
*  Last 
*  Length - Done 
*  Lookup 
*  Lpred - Done.  Return the array ("list") element before the specified one. 
*  Lsucc  - Done.  Return the array ("list") element after the specified one. 
*  Map - Done.   
*  NotElem ( Array non-membership  (the "not in" operator) )  
*  Nub (removes duplicates from a list) 
*  NubBy 
*  Partition 
*  Replicate 
*  Scan - Done  
*  Sequence - the (<|) (|>) and (><) operators in Haskell.   
*  Show 
*  Shows 
*  Snd  
*  Sort  
*  SplitAt 
*  Slice - Done 
*  Tail - Done 
*  Take  
*  Transpose 
*  Union 
*  UnionBy 
*  Unzip  
*  Zip 
*  ZipWith 


This code is released to the public domain.
