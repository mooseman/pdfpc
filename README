*** Public Domain Functional Programming in C *** 

This small project is aimed at creating some public-domain C code (using a functional-programming approach) 
for manipulating data structures - mostly lists.  

Acknowledgement - I have included the file "stb.h" in this project.  That is a very good public-domain C utility 
library. It was done by Sean Barrett, and is from here - http://nothings.org/stb/stb_h.html .  
Many thanks to Sean for doing that! 
*********************************************************************************************************************************

The aim is for pdfpc to eventually cover all of the following areas.  
Note that Lpred and Lsucc are different to Haskell's "pred" and "succ" functions.  
Those functions work on enums - these ones work on arrays.  

*  Filter 
*  Map  
*  Sort  
*  Any 
*  All 
*  Elem ( Array membership  (the "in" operator)  ) 
*  NotElem ( Array non-membership  (the "not in" operator)   )  
*  Init 
*  Last 
*  Lookup 
*  Lpred - Done.  Return the array ("list") element before the specified one. 
*  Lsucc  - Done.  Return the array ("list") element after the specified one. 
*  Replicate 
*  SplitAt 
*  Concat (join) 
*  Slice - Done 
*  Head - Done 
*  Tail - Done 
*  Length - Done 
*  Take  
*  Drop  
*  Foldl  
*  Foldr  
*  Zip 

This code is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy....."   ;)
