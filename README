*** Public Domain Functional Programming in C *** 

This small project is aimed at creating some public-domain C code (using a functional-programming approach) 
for manipulating data structures - mostly lists.  

The aim is to eventually cover all of the following areas -  

*  List creation - Done.  Many thanks to Kurt Kuzba who did the public-domain linked-list code used here. 
   Many thanks also to "kermi3" at Cprogramming.com who did the mygetch() function - this is a "getch()" 
   equivalent which works on *nix.    
*  Filter 
*  Map  
*  Sort  
*  Concat (join) 
*  Split, subset. Select a subset of a list's elements.  
*  Head 
*  Tail 
*  Length 
*  Take  
*  Drop  
*  Foldl  
*  Foldr  
*  Zip 
*  Membership  (the "in" operator)  
*  Non-membership  (the "not in" operator)  


This code is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy....."   ;)
